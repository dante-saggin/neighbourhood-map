# My future trip to Rome
 This map quite simple there are some places where I want to go in rome
 - You can select any of the places where I pretend to go and this will be show on map with some information recovered from the foursquare
 - After selecting one place the information of the other will disapear from the map
 - You can filter the places using the input bar on the top of screen.
To execute just open index.html in the scr folder and be happy


#Nexts Steps
- Create the grunt to generate the code for production
- Retrieve more places from foursquare instead of only picking up the pre defined list
